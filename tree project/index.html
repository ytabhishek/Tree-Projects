        <h3>Why Tree Are Important?</h3>

    <div class="theroy">
        <h6>  <h6>Trees are important to the environment and to humans in many ways, including:
            Air quality
            Trees improve air quality by absorbing harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone through their leaves and bark, and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. In urban areas, trees also remove dust and smoke particles from the air.
            Climate change
            Trees act as carbon sinks, offsetting carbon and reducing the effects of climate change.
            Water
            Trees store and filter more than half of the water supply in the United States, removing pollutants and sediments from rainfall and slowly releasing cleaner water back into waterways and aquifers. This makes the water easier and cheaper to treat before it reaches our taps, and also helps to stabilize the water supply.
            Soil
            Tree roots bind soil together, preventing erosion. Tree canopies also reduce erosion caused by falling rain, and their roots help to create conditions in the soil that promote infiltration.
            Biodiversity
            Trees provide food, cover, and places to raise young for a wide variety of species, including pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds. This helps to maintain ecosystem balance and biodiversity, which can also benefit humans.</h6></h6>
